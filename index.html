									<h2><a>District Dance Battle Telemetry</a></h2>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/ddb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> District Dance Battle is a rhythm game we developed in 2019. After some time, we decided to do some Telemetry tests
										to ensure some suspicions we had. These are the results.

										<h2><a>Distances total</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/distanciasTotal.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This image shows the total distances in the inputs the players made. By distance we mean the accuracy of the players
										when hitting correctly a note in the game. We divided it with 2 points of separation for more accuracy in the study.

										<h2><a>Max Combo mean</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/MaxComboMedia.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>After the study, we can see that the players tend to obtain more combo in the early songs. The result was expected
										because the early levels are easier that the ones later in the game.
									</p>

										<h2><a>Combo time mean</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/TiempoComboMedia.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> On the other hand, we observed that the levels where the players maintain the combo the most amount of time are some of the extra
										songs. We can explain this by pointing out that the design in the extra levels are more consistent that the first ones 
										we made.

										<h2><a>Times completed each level</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NVecesCadaNivel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This graphic didn't suprise us. We knew from previous experience which were the most popular levels, and we can see
										it yet again in this graphic.
									</p>

										<h2><a>Times lost each level</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NVecesPierdeCadaNivel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Similar to the previous graphic, we also knew which levels were the most difficult and the ones where the players failed
										the most. We can see it again in this graphic.
									</p>

								</article>
								<article>
									<header>
										<h2><a>Scores mean</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/PuntuacionMedia.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Same as before. We can see in this graphic that the players get higher scores in the early levels, and less score in the difficult
										levels. Some levels have infimum scores due to the players losing right away when starting these levels.
									</p>

										<h2><a>Input type<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/TiposInput.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Surprisingly, players prefer playing with controllers but with the Arrows option. This option lets players play with XBox or PS4
										controllers but on but on both sides of the screen it shows arrows.

										<h2><a>Mistakes in level 2<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Nivel2Errores.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This graphic shows the mistakes made by all players in level 2 - Eminemcia. We show this one as an
										example because it is the most significative, but we have one of each level. Due to the lack of
										testers, results are not significative enough, but with more tests we will be able to obtain better
										results.

										<h2><a>Dialogues skipped<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/skip.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Players don't usually like reading dialogues. But this graphic shows that players don't skip dialogues.
										Why? Because they don't know which button is the skip button, or at least that's what wh think it is happening.
